# Essential wepback2 + PostCSS boilerplate

A super minimal, basic and essential boilerplate that I use as starter-kit for my personal projects!

## What is rocking here:
* Webpack 2 (with tree-shaking)
* PostCSS
  * postcss-import
  * postcss-cssnext
* Babel (ES6 | ES2015)
* Jest
* JS linters
* Style linters


## Soon
* Jest with ES6
* CSS basic theme boilerplate


## Install

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Go to http://localhost:3000/


* `npm test` - run tests with Jest
* `npm run build` - create /build folder


Make sure you have NodeJs and Webpack 2 installed globally.

Have fun!
