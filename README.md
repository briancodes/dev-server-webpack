## How to rock
* `git clone https://github.com/sandrina-p/essential-webpack-boilerplate.git your-project`
* `cd your-project` - go to `/your-project` folder
* `npm install` - get everything to run the project
* `npm start` - run the project... wait a few seconds
* A tab on Chrome should open - *http://localhost:3001/* - you can rock with it ðŸ’¥
* `npm test` - don't forget to test your code
* `npm run build` - set all the code ready and minified into `/build` folder


## Before you start
- Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) `npm i -g webpack`


## How to Add Multiple files
Despite this boilerplate being set for only 1 page - `index.html`, I prepared things for you in case you want to add more pages.

Todo do that you need to add the HTML and JS files to `config/webpack.config.js`:

- On `line 76` you have all your project Pages. Each `new HtmlWebpackPlugin` is used to create a new page.

```js
// YOUR PROJECT PAGES
new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
    chunks: ['index'], // where it is reading the JS / CSS files from
    template: './index.html', // location of the HTML file.
}),
```

- To add a new page, just create a new instance of `HtmlWebpackPlugin` and on your project create your HTML file. In this case the file is at `./pages/my-page.index.html`.

```js
new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
    chunks: ['index'],
    template: './index.html',
}),
new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
    chunks: ['my-page'],
    template: './pages/my-page/index.html',
}),
```

`chunks: ['my-page'],` refers to the key name of your JS file associated to your page.

That key is on `line 26`. There you set the entry points for your project. Each entry point is a JS file:

```js
entry: {
    'index': './index.js',
    // If you want to add more pages, just pass the path to your .js file 1/2
    // 'my-page': './pages/my-page/index.js',
},
```

Now just add a new entry-point (key) with the same name as the `chunks` value used on the step before.

```js
entry: {
    'index': './index.js',
    'my-page': './pages/my-page/index.js',
},
```

That's it. Save the file, `npm start` again and you are ready to keep rocking!

- You also can have HTML files that use the same JS file as entry points.

```js
new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
    chunks: ['index'],
    template: './index.html',
}),
new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
    chunks: ['index'], // read from the same entry point as `index.html`
    template: './pages/my-page/about.html',
}),
```
