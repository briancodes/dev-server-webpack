# Essencial wepback 2 boilerplate

A super minimal, basic and essencial boilerplate that I use as starter-kit for my personal projects!

## What is rocking here:


* Webpack 2 (with tree-shaking)
* PostCss
  * postcss-cssnext
  * postcss-css-variables
  * postcss-mixins [CSS mixins in JS with Unit Tests](https://medium.com/p/825b41728a55)
* Babel (ES6 | ES2015)
* Jest

## Soon
* JS linters
* Style linters
* ES6 on postcss mixins
* CSS basic theme boilerplate


## Install

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Go to http://localhost:3000/


* `npm test` - run tests with Jest
* `npm run build` - create /build folder


Make sure you have NodeJs and Webpack 2 installed globally.

Have fun!
